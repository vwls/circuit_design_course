#Circuit Design and Fabrication
Take your circuits beyond the breadboard! Designing PCBs is a great way to clean up a breadboard rats nests and improve the realability and reproduceability, while reducing size of your projects. Also, designing your own circuits offers new creative and aesthetic spaces to explore within your projects (e.g. you want your circuit to have zigzags or curls? Now you can!) 

This repo serves to collect documents relating to circuit design and fabrication course. This course teaches circuit design from EagleCAD through home fabrication.

##Circuit Design
EagleCAD is the industry standard circuit design software. Aslo, it's free to use (with some board size restrictions) and has a massive user base. 

We will learn Eagle by designing the same circuit schematic (``.sch`` file) and then working through our own individual board designs (``.brd`` file).

Finally, we will go over how to export these files for a variety of fabrication methods.

##Fabrication
We will start with a shallow survey of the home and professional fabrication landscape.

This portion will focus on the photo tranfer-acid etch method. This is the cheapest, most precise, and often fastest, approach to home PCB fabrication. Shorter versions of this course will focuse primarily on this method, but also demonstrate how to send designs files to a board house for professional fabrication. Everyone will leave this course with their very own handmade PCBs!  

##Prerequisites
This course begins where many physical computing courses finish - it will not cover how breadboard a circuit or how to write embedded software for a system. Students with some prior knowledge of physical computing will find this course most useful.
